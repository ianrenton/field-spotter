# POTA/SOTA Field Spotter

**Work in progress - not yet functional**

A mobile-first progressive web app to display live POTA & SOTA spots on a geographic map, and on a frequency band. Designed for use in the field to locate park-to-park and summit-to-summit opportunities in a more intuitive way than the POTA and SOTA websites' spot lists. It can of course also be used from home by POTA and SOTA chasers.

## Motivation

The POTA and SOTA websites have their own pages showing "spots", but these are generally text-based and ordered by time. As a European POTA activator, I find they are also dominated by North American stations which I have no hope of contacting.

I wanted something based on a map display, so when operating on the 40m band with an NVIS antenna I could see more local activations for park-to-park contacts, or on 20m I could zoom out to Europe.

The only existing program I found with the functionality I wanted was GridTracker, which is great, but only available as a desktop application. I don't tend to bring a laptop to my POTA adventures, so I wanted something that worked on my phone.
